# LIS4930-Final-Project
My Github Post for Intro to Python. 
This is the RNG project created by Nicholas Bonfiglio for LIS4930 Intro to Python. I had a lot of fun thinking, coding, and debugging this project as I use RNG to makae choices or solve debates sometimes. Having my own creation makes for a more prideful expirence when I come back and use my creation instead of online websites.
